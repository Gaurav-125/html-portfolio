<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I am a dedicated and curious third-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering.
   My technical foundation spans across core programming languages like Java, C, and C++,
    allowing me to build both console-based and GUI-driven applications with a focus on modular design and
     efficiency. I've developed strong problem-solving skills through hands-on experience with data 
     structures, algorithms, and simulations. I actively engage with real-world concepts such as socket programming, 
     networking models, and JSON-based APIs to deepen my understanding and broaden my technical toolkit.
</p>

<p>Currently, I’m expanding my expertise into web development, driven by a desire to
   create practical, user-centric solutions.
   I approach every project with a mindset of simplicity, scalability, and creativity—whether
    it's crafting an interactive dashboard,
    designing software tools, or brainstorming chatbot features.
    My passion lies in bridging foundational programming knowledge with
     emerging technologies to build intelligent and accessible applications that solve real problems.</p>
